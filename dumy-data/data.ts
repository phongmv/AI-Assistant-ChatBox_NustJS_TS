            "answer": "**Here are a few examples of how Git is used:**\n\n1. **Branching:** You can create a new branch to work on a feature or bug fix.\n   - Example: `git branch feature-x` - Creates a new branch called `feature-x`.\n   - Example: `git checkout -b feature-x` - Creates and switches to a new branch called `feature-x`.\n\n2. **Committing:** After making changes to your code, you can commit them with a message.\n   - Example: `git commit -m 'Added login feature'` - Saves your changes with the message 'Added login feature'.\n   - Example: `git commit -am 'Fixed typo'` - Stages and commits all modified files with the message 'Fixed typo'.\n\n3. **Merging:** Once your work on a branch is done, you can merge it into the main branch.\n   - Example: `git merge feature-x` - Integrates `feature-x` into the main branch.\n   - Example: `git merge --no-ff feature-x` - Merges `feature-x` with a merge commit, preserving history.\n\n4. **Stashing:** Temporarily save changes that are not yet ready to be committed.\n   - Example: `git stash` - Saves your current work and reverts to the last commit.\n   - Example: `git stash pop` - Applies the most recent stash and removes it from the stash list.\n\n5. **Tagging:** Create a tag to mark a specific point in history.\n   - Example: `git tag v1.0` - Tags the current commit as version 1.0.\n   - Example: `git tag -a v1.1 -m 'Version 1.1'` - Creates an annotated tag with a message 'Version 1.1'.\n\n6. **Rebasing:** Reapply commits on top of another base tip.\n   - Example: `git rebase main` - Reapplies commits from the current branch onto `main`.\n   - Example: `git rebase -i HEAD~3` - Interactively rebase the last 3 commits for editing.\n\n7. **Cherry-picking:** Apply the changes introduced by some existing commits.\n   - Example: `git cherry-pick 1234567` - Apply the changes from commit `1234567` to the current branch.\n   - Example: `git cherry-pick -n 1234567` - Apply the changes from commit `1234567` without committing them.\n\n8. **Bisecting:** Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug.\n   - Example: `git bisect start` - Start the bisect process.\n   - Example: `git bisect bad` - Mark the current commit as bad.\n   - Example: `git bisect good <commit>` - Mark a known good commit to help identify the bad commit."

Each branch represents an independent line of work, enabling developers to work on features, fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase. Branches can later be merged to integrate changes back into the main branch."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is merging in Git?",
            "answer": "Merging in Git is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. When developers complete work on a feature branch, they merge it into the main branch to incorporate the changes. Git uses a three-way merge algorithm to combine changes and resolve conflicts if the same parts of the code were modified in both branches."
